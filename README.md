# Quarto!

A console version of the board game "Quarto !" by Gigamic. You can player versus another player switching keyboard, or versus a pretty good AI, or a pretty bad AI. And you can save a game to reload it later if it takes too long.

### Context

This project was made by Guillaume GROSSE and Hugo FOURNIER in December 2018 and January 2019 for our computer science class at the ENSC.


### Demonstration

Here is a 1 minute 30s long video demonstration of the game that I commented in french : https://youtu.be/4iV89YWV0ps
One day I shall subtitle it in english, promised.
